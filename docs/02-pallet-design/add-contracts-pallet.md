# Use the Contracts pallet
_Create the basis for building Wasm smart contracts using FRAME._

## Goal
Add the Contracts pallet to your runtime to be able to use Wasm smart contracts in your blockchain.

## Use cases
- Smart Contract develoment
- On-chain execution of Wasm binaries

## Overview
This guide will show you how you can add the [Contracts pallet][contracts-frame] to your runtime in order to allow your blockchain 
to support Wasm smart contracts. You can follow similar patterns to add additional FRAME pallets to your runtime, 
however you should note that each pallet is a little different in terms of the specific configuration settings 
needed to use it correctly.

:::note 
You should already have the latest version of the Substrate Node Template compiled on your computer to follow this guide. 
If you haven't already done so, refer to [this tutorial][create-first-chain-tutorial].
