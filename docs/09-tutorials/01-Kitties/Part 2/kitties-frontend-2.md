## Overview

In this section, we are going to build the custom components of our Kitty application's front-end.

To recap, these are:

- **the `Kitties.js` component:** this renders KittyCards.js.
- **the `KittyAvatar.js` component:** this handles the logic that creates an avatar for a Kitty in storage
- **the `KittyCards.js` component:** this creates a React  card component to hold Kitty ID, gender,
DNA, owner and price

## Learning outcomes

:arrow_right: &nbsp; Use Polkadot-JS API to create custom React components.

## Steps

### 1. Create the `Kitties.js` component

This is the component that will get rendered by `Apps.js`, the top-most level component. So it does
the heavy lifting, with the help of `KittyAvatar.js` and `KittCards.js`.

Start by creating a file called `src/Kitties.js` and paste the following imports:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Form, Grid } from 'semantic-ui-react';

import { useSubstrate } from './substrate-lib';
import { TxButton } from './substrate-lib/components';

import KittyCards from './KittyCards';
```

The way our custom components make use of Polkadot-JS API is by using `substrate-lib`, which is a
wrapper around [Polkadot JS API instance](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/create/) and
allows us to retrieve account keys from the [Polkadot-JS keyring](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/keyring).
This is why we use `useSubstrate` which is exported by `src/substrate-lib/SubstrateContext.js` and
used to create the wrapper.

Then, there's a couple things to set up:

- we'll need a function to help construct the Kitty ID from a storage key
- we'll need a function to hold all Kitty objects
- we'll subscribe to the chain storage item changes and rely on React hook `useEffect` to update our
component states.

Proceed by pasting in the following code snippet:

```javascript
// Construct a Kitty ID from storage key
const convertToKittyHash = entry =>
  `0x${entry[0].toJSON().slice(-64)}`;

// Construct a Kitty object 
const constructKitty = (hash, { dna, price, gender, owner }) => ({
  id: hash,
  dna,
  price: price.toJSON(),
  gender: gender.toJSON(),
  owner: owner.toJSON()
});

// Use React hooks
export default function Kitties (props) {
  const { api, keyring } = useSubstrate();
  const { accountPair } = props;

  const [kittyHashes, setKittyHashes] = useState([]);
  const [kitties, setKitties] = useState([]);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('');
// snip
```
There are two things our app needs to listen (subscribe) for: changes in the amount of Kitties and
changes in Kitty objects. To do this we'll create a subscription function for each.

The way we're going to listen for a change in the amount of Kitties is by querying our node using
`api.query.kitties.kittyCnt`, which queries `KittyCnt` from our Kitties pallet storage item. Then,
we'll use the `entries()` method from Polkadot-JS API to get Kitty IDs and transform them to be
more display-friendly with `convertToKittyHash` function.

Paste the following snippet:

```javascript
// Subscription function for setting Kitty IDs
const subscribeKittyCnt = () => {
  let unsub = null;

  const asyncFetch = async () => {
      // Query KittyCnt from runtime
    unsub = await api.query.kitties.kittyCnt(async cnt => {
      // Fetch all Kitty objects using entries()
      const entries = await api.query.kitties.kitties.entries();
      // Retrieve only the Kitty ID and set to state
      const hashes = entries.map(convertToKittyHash);
      setKittyHashes(hashes);
    });
  };

  asyncFetch();

  // return the unsubscription cleanup function
  return () => {
    unsub && unsub();
  };
};
```

:::tip Further Learning 
`entries()` is a Polkadot-JS API function that gives us the entire storage map of `Kitties` that we
defined in Part 1. If there's nothing in the storage, it returns `None`. All functions that interact
with a chain will always return a **Promise** in Polkadot-JS API. So we wait for it to be resolved,
and return us all the map keys and objects.

You can see this in action if you go to the console of your browser running a node Front-end and
entering `entries`, or get the first Kitty object in storage by doing: `entries[0][1].toJSON()`.
:::

Similarly for `subscribeKitties`, paste the following code snippet:

```javascript
// Subscription function to construct a Kitty object
const subscribeKitties = () => {
  let unsub = null;

  const asyncFetch = async () => {
    // Get Kitty objects from storage
    unsub = await api.query.kitties.kitties.multi(kittyHashes, kitties => {
      // Create an array of Kitty objects from `constructKitty`
      const kittyArr = kitties
        .map((kitty, ind) => constructKitty(kittyHashes[ind], kitty.value));
      // Set the array of Kitty objects to state
      setKitties(kittyArr);
    });
  };

  asyncFetch();

  // return the unsubscription cleanup function
  return () => {
    unsub && unsub();
  };
};
```

#### Understanding how we retrieve the Kitty Hash

Substrate storage item key is composed of a concatenation of the hash of the pallet name, the hash
of the storage item name, and finally the hash of the key used in the map. Now we want to extract
only the key for the map, so we extract the last 64 bytes out in our `convertToKittyHash` function.

```js
const convertToKittyHash = entry =>
  `0x${entry[0].toJSON().slice(-64)}`;
```

And then we use it in the subscription function to transform an entry to its display hash:

```js
const asyncFetch = async () => {
  unsub = await api.query.kitties.kittyCnt(async cnt => {
    // Fetch all kitty keys
    const entries = await api.query.kitties.kitties.entries();
    const hashes = entries.map(convertToKittyHash);
    setKittyHashes(hashes);
  });
};
```

#### Clean up functions

In `asyncFetch` we have subscribed to the Kitties storage. When the component is teared down, we
want to make sure the subscription is cleaned up (unsubscribed). So we return a clean up function
for the effect hook. Refer to
[Effects with Cleanup](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#effects-with-cleanup):

```js
  // return the unsubscription cleanup function
    return () => {
      unsub && unsub();
    };
  };
```
Now all that's left to do for our component to listen for changes in our node's runtime storgae is
to pass in `subscribeKittyCnt` and `subscribeKitties` to React's `useEffect` function. Hence:

```js
  useEffect(subscribeKittyCnt, [api, keyring]);
  useEffect(subscribeKitties, [api, kittyHashes]);
```

Learn more about how "Effect Hooks" work in [React's documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html).

Congratulations! We have setup the ground work of accessing the chain and save all kitty information
internally in React. We will then access and display them in the following sections.

### 2. Create the `KittyAvatar.js` component

In this component, all we're doing is mapping a library of PNG images to the bytes of our Kitty DNA.
Since it's mostly all Javascript, we won't be going into too much detail on how it is built.

Create a file `src/KittyAvatar.js` and paste in the following code:

```js
import React from 'react';

// Generate an array [start, start + 1, ..., end] inclusively
const genArray = (start, end) =>
  Array.from(Array(end - start + 1).keys()).map(v => v + start);

const IMAGES = {
  accessory: genArray(1, 20).map(n =>
    `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/KittyAvatar/accessorie_${n}.png`),
  body: genArray(1, 15).map(n =>
    `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/KittyAvatar/body_${n}.png`),
  eyes: genArray(1, 15).map(n =>
    `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/KittyAvatar/eyes_${n}.png`),
  mouth: genArray(1, 10).map(n =>
    `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/KittyAvatar/mouth_${n}.png`),
  fur: genArray(1, 10).map(n =>
    `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/KittyAvatar/fur_${n}.png`)
};

const dnaToAttributes = dna => {
  const attribute = (index, type) => IMAGES[type][dna[index] % IMAGES[type].length];

  return {
    body: attribute(0, 'body'),
    eyes: attribute(1, 'eyes'),
    accessory: attribute(2, 'accessory'),
    fur: attribute(3, 'fur'),
    mouth: attribute(4, 'mouth')
  };
};

const KittyAvatar = props => {
  const outerStyle = { height: '160px', position: 'relative', width: '50%' };
  const innerStyle = { height: '150px', position: 'absolute', top: '3%', left: '50%' };
  const { dna } = props;

  if (!dna) return null;

  const cat = dnaToAttributes(dna);
  return <div style={outerStyle}>
    <img alt='body' src={cat.body} style={innerStyle} />
    <img alt='fur' src={cat.fur} style={innerStyle} />
    <img alt='mouth' src={cat.mouth} style={innerStyle} />
    <img alt='eyes' src={cat.eyes} style={innerStyle} />
    <img alt='accessory' src={cat.accessory} style={innerStyle} />
  </div>;
};

export default KittyAvatar;
```

Notice that the only properties being passed in is `dna`, which will be passed from `KittyCards.js`.
The logic in this component is based on a specific
["cat avatar generator" library](https://framagit.org/Deevad/cat-avatar-generator/-/tree/master/avatars/cat)
by David Revoy. Download it and paste its contents inside a new folder called "KittyAvatar" in
`public/assets/KittyAvatar`.

### 3. Create the `TransferModal` in `KittyCards.js`

Our `KittyCards.js` component will have three sections to it:

i. `TransferModal`: a modal that uses the `TxButton` component. 

ii. `KittyCard`: a card that renders the Kitty avatar using the `KittyAvatar` component as well
as all other Kitty information (id, dna, owner, gender and price).

iii. `KittyCards`: a component that renders a grid for `KittyCard` (yes, singular!) described above. 

As a preliminary step, create a new file called `KittyCards.js` and add the following imports:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Button, Card, Grid, Message, Modal, Form, Label } from 'semantic-ui-react';

import KittyAvatar from './KittyAvatar'; 
import { TxButton } from './substrate-lib/components';
```

#### i. Outlining the TransferModal

Let's outline what the `TransferModal` will do. Conveniently, the Substrate Front-end Template comes
with a component called `TxButton` which is a useful way to include a transfer button that interacts
with a node. This component will allow us to send a transaction into our node and trigger a
signed extrinsic for the Kitties pallet.

The way it is built can be broken down into the following pieces:

- A "transfer" button exists, which opens up a modal upon being clicked.
- This modal, we'll call "Kitty Transfer" is a `Form` containing (1) the Kitty ID and (2) an input
field for a receiving address.
- It also contains a "transfer" and "cancel" button.

See the screenshot taken below for reference: 

![Kitty Transfer](kitty-transfer-shot.png)

#### ii. Setting up React hooks

The first thing we'll do is to extract properties (or "props") we need, `kitty`, `accountPair`, and
`setStatus`. Do this by pasting in the following code snippet:

```js
const TransferModal = props => {
  const { kitty, accountPair, setStatus } = props;
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const [formValue, setFormValue] = React.useState({});

  const formChange = key => (ev, el) => {
    setFormValue({ ...formValue, [key]: el.value });
  };
```

We also create a `confirmAndClose` function to be passed in to `TxButton` component, being called
when a confirmation action is triggered. This function will receive a unsubscription function from
`TxButton`. In addition to call this function for clean up, we will just close the modal dialog box.
Paste the following snippet:

```js
  const confirmAndClose = (unsub) => {
    unsub();
    setOpen(false);
  };
```

#### iii. Composing the modal

To recap: our Kitty Card has a "transfer" button that opens up a 
modal where a user can choose an address to send their Kitty to. That modal will have:

- a Title
- an read-only field for a Kitty ID
- an input field for an Account ID

In addition, it will have:

- a "Cancel" button which closes the Transfer modal
- the `TxButton` React component to trigger the transaction

Here's what this looks like in code &mdash; paste this in to complete `TransferModal` and read the
comments to follow what each chunk of code is doing:

```js
return <Modal onClose={() => setOpen(false)} onOpen={() => setOpen(true)} open={open}
    trigger={<Button basic color='blue'>Transfer</Button>}>

    {/* The title of the modal */}
    <Modal.Header>Kitty Transfer</Modal.Header>

    <Modal.Content><Form>
      {/* The modal's inputs fields */}
      <Form.Input fluid label='Kitty ID' readOnly value={kitty.id}/>
      <Form.Input fluid label='Receiver' placeholder='Receiver Address' onChange={formChange('target')}/>
    </Form></Modal.Content>

    <Modal.Actions>
      {/* The cancel button */}
      <Button basic color='grey' onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>Cancel</Button>
      {/* The TxButton component */}
      <TxButton
        accountPair={accountPair} label='Transfer' type='SIGNED-TX' setStatus={setStatus}
        onClick={confirmAndClose}
        attrs={{
          palletRpc: 'kitties',
          callable: 'transfer',
          inputParams: [formValue.target, kitty.id],
          paramFields: [true, true]
        }}
      />
    </Modal.Actions>
  </Modal>;
```

The next part of our `KittyCards.js` component is to create the part that renders the
`KittyAvatar.js` component and the data passed in from the `kitties` props in `Kitty.js`.

### 4. Create the `KittyCard` in `KittyCards.js`

We'll use React's `Card` component to create a card that render the Kitty avatar as well as the
Kitty ID, DNA, gender, owner and price.

As you might have guessed, we'll use React props to pass in data to our KittyCard. Paste the
following code snippet, reading through the comments to understand what it does:

```js
// Use props
const KittyCard = props => {
  const { kitty, accountPair, setStatus } = props;
  const { id = null, dna = null, owner = null, gender = null, price = null } = kitty;
  const displayDna = dna && dna.toJSON();
  const isSelf = accountPair.address === kitty.owner;
```

Now let's make use of the previously imported `Card` component:

```js
return <Card>
  { isSelf && <Label as='a' floating color='teal'>Mine</Label> }
  {/* Render the Kitty Avatar */}
  <KittyAvatar dna={dna.toU8a()} />
  <Card.Content>
    {/* Display the Kitty ID */}
    <Card.Header style={{ fontSize: '1em', overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>
      ID: {id}
    </Card.Header>
    {/* Display the Kitty DNA */}
    <Card.Meta style={{ fontSize: '.9em', overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>
      DNA: {displayDna}
    </Card.Meta>
    {/* Display the Kitty ID, Gender, Owner and Price */}
    <Card.Description>
      <p style={{ overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>
        Gender: {gender}
      </p>
      <p style={{ overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>
        Owner: {owner}
      </p>
      <p style={{ overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>
        Price: {price}
      </p>
    </Card.Description>
  </Card.Content>
  // ...
```

Before closing the `<Card/>` component we want to render the `TransferModal` we privously built
&mdash; **only if the Kitty is transferrable by its owner**. Paste this code snippet to handle this
functionality:

```js
  {/* Render the transfer button using TransferModal */}
  <Card.Content extra style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>{
    owner === accountPair.address
      ? <TransferModal kitty={kitty} accountPair={accountPair} setStatus={setStatus}/>
      : ''
  }</Card.Content>
</Card>;
```

#### Rendering the card

It's time to put all the pieces we've built together. In this function, we will:

- Check whether there's any Kitties to render and render a _"No Kitty found here... Create one now!"_
message if there aren't any.
- If there are, render them in a 3 column grid.

Have a look at the comments to understand the parts of this code snippet:

```js
const KittyCards = props => {
  const { kitties, accountPair, setStatus } = props;

  {/* Check the number of Kitties */}
  if (kitties.length === 0) {
    return <Message info>
      <Message.Header>No Kitty found here... Create one now!&nbsp;
        <span role='img' aria-label='point-down'>👇</span>
      </Message.Header>
    </Message>;
  }
  {/* Render Kitties using Kitty Card in a grid */}
  return <Grid columns={3}>{kitties.map((kitty, i) =>
    <Grid.Column key={`kitty-${i}`}>
      <KittyCard kitty={kitty} accountPair={accountPair} setStatus={setStatus}/>
    </Grid.Column>
  )}</Grid>;
};
```

And complete the component with:

```js
export default KittyCards;
```

### 5. Complete `Kitties.js`

Now that we've built all the bits for our front-end application, we can piece everything together.

Go back to the incompleted `Kitties.js` file and paste this code snippet to render the
`KittyCard.js` component inside a `<Grid/>`:

```js
return <Grid.Column width={16}>
  <h1>Kitties</h1>
  <KittyCards kitties={kitties} accountPair={accountPair} setStatus={setStatus}/>
```

Now we'll use the `<Form/>` component to render our application's `TxButton` component: 

```js
    <Form style={{ margin: '1em 0' }}>
      <Form.Field style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
        <TxButton
          accountPair={accountPair} label='Create Kitty' type='SIGNED-TX' setStatus={setStatus}
          attrs={{
            palletRpc: 'kitties',
            callable: 'createKitty',
            inputParams: [],
            paramFields: []
          }}
        />
      </Form.Field>
    </Form>
    <div style={{ overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}>{status}</div>
  </Grid.Column>;
```

### 6. Update App.js

Finally, to render Kitties.js, we want to add a new row to the `<Container/>` in App.js:

```js
<Grid.Row>
  <Kitties accountPair={accountPair} />
</Grid.Row>
```
