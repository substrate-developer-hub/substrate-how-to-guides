# Uniqueness, custom types and storage maps

_In this part of the tutorial, we'll build out the components of our pallet needed to manage the
 creation and ownership of our Kitties._

## Overview

This part of the tutorial dives into some pillar concepts for developing pallets with FRAME
(stands for **Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities**). On top of learning how
to use existing types and traits, you'll learn how create your own types like providing your pallet
with a `Gender` type. At the end of this part, you will have implemented the remaining two storage
items according to the logic outlined for the Substrate Kitty application [in the overview of this
tutorial](../overview#what-were-building).

## Learning Outcomes

## Steps

### 1. Scaffold Kitty Struct

We added additional comments to the code from Part I (in the `/pallets/kitties/src/lib.rs` file)
to better assist you with the action items in this part of the tutorial. To follow each step with
ease, you can just replace your code with the [helper code][helper-code-pt2] provided below:

:::note
If you're feeling confident, you can use the code from the previous part and use the comments marked
as "TODO" to follow each step instead of pasting in the helper file for this part.
:::

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

pub use pallet::*;

#[frame_support::pallet]
pub mod pallet {
	use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
	use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;
	use frame_support::{
		sp_runtime::traits::Hash,
		traits::{ Randomness, Currency, tokens::ExistenceRequirement },
		transactional
	};
	use sp_io::hashing::blake2_128;

	#[cfg(feature = "std")]
	use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

	// ACTION #1: Write a Struct to hold Kitty information.

	// ACTION #2: Enum declaration for Gender.

	#[pallet::pallet]
	#[pallet::generate_store(trait Store)]
	pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

	/// Configure the pallet by specifying the parameters and types it depends on.
	#[pallet::config]
	pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
		/// Because this pallet emits events, it depends on the runtime's definition of an event.
		type Event: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::Event>;

		/// The Currency handler for the Kitties pallet.
		type Currency: Currency<Self::AccountId>;

		// ACTION #5: Specify the type for Randomness we want to specify for runtime.
	}

	// Errors.
	#[pallet::error]
	pub enum Error<T> {
		// TODO Part III
	}

	// Events.
	#[pallet::event]
	#[pallet::metadata(T::AccountId = "AccountId")]
	#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
	pub enum Event<T: Config> {
		// TODO Part III
	}

	#[pallet::storage]
	#[pallet::getter(fn all_kitties_count)]
	pub(super) type AllKittiesCount<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u64, ValueQuery>;

	// ACTION #6: Add Nonce storage item.

	// ACTION #9: Remaining storage items.

	// TODO Part IV: Our pallet's genesis configuration.

	#[pallet::call]
	impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {

		// TODO Part III: create_kitty

		// TODO Part III: set_price

		// TODO Part III: transfer

		// TODO Part III: buy_kitty

		// TODO Part III: breed_kitty
	}

	// ACTION #4: helper function for Kitty struct

	impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
		// TODO Part III: helper functions for dispatchable functions

		// ACTION #7: increment_nonce helper

		// ACTION #8: random_hash helper

		// TODO: mint, transfer_from

	}
}
```


#### A. What information to include

**Struct** in Rust is a useful construct to help storing data that have things in common. For our
  purposes, our Kitty will carry multiple properties which we can store in a single struct instead
  of using separate storage items. This comes in handy when trying to optimize for storage reads and
  writes so our runtime can perform less read/writes to update multiple values. Read more about
  storage best practices [here][storage-best-practice-kb].

Let's first go over what information a single Kitty will carry:

- **`dna`**: the hash used to identify the DNA of a Kitty, which corresponds to its unique features.
    DNA is also used to breed new Kitties and to keep track of different Kitty generations.
- **`price`**: this is a balance that corresponds to the amount needed to buy a Kitty and set by its
    owner.
- **`gender`**: an enum that can be either `Male` or `Female`.
- **`owner`**: an account ID designating a single owner.

#### B. Sketching out the types held by our struct

Looking at the items of our struct from
[Step 1A](/docs/Tutorials/Kitties/Part%201/create-kitties#a-what-information-to-include), we can
deduce the following types:

- **`[u8; 16]`** for `dna` - to use 16 bytes to represent a Kitty's DNA.
- **`BalanceOf`** for `price` - this is a custom type using FRAME's [`Currency` trait]
    [currency-frame].
- **`Gender`** for `gender` - we will create this!

First, we will need to add in our custom types for `BalanceOf` and `AccountOf` before we declare our
struct. Replace ACTION #1 with the following snippet:

```rust
type AccountOf<T> = <T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId;
type BalanceOf<T> =
	<<T as Config>::Currency as Currency<<T as frame_system::Config>::AccountId>>::Balance;

// Struct for holding Kitty information.
#[derive(Clone, Encode, Decode, Default, PartialEq)]
pub struct Kitty<T: Config> {
	pub dna: [u8; 16],
	pub price: Option<BalanceOf<T>>,
	pub gender: Gender,
	pub owner: AccountOf<T>,
}
```

:::note
We define `<BalanceOf<T>>` and `AccountOf<T>` types, and use them in the `Kitty`. If you wonder what
the first line means in Rust, it is to define a type alias `AccountOf<T>` which is just a shorthand
pointing to the associated type `AccountId` of trait `frame_system::Config` that generic type `T`
is required to be bound of.

More about this type of syntax is covered in
[the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#specifying-placeholder-types-in-trait-definitions-with-associated-types).
:::

Notice how we use the derive macro to include [various helper traits][prelude-traits-rustdocs] for
using our struct. For type `Gender`, we will need to build out our own custom enum and helper
functions. Now is a good time to do that.

:::note
We use `Option<BalanceOf<T>>` instead of `BalanceOf<T>` for `price` field, so a Kitty price can be
	set to `None` to indicate the Kitty is not for sale.
:::

### 2. Write a Custom Type For `Gender`

We have just created a struct that requires a custom type called `Gender`. This type will handle an
enum defining our Kitty's gender. To create it, you'll build out the following parts:

- **An enum declaration**, which specifies `Male` and `Female` values.
- **A function to configure a defaut value**, based on the enum.

#### A. Enums

Replace ACTION #2 with the following enum declaration:

```rust
#[derive(Encode, Decode, Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum Gender {
	Male,
	Female,
}
```

Notice the use of the [derive macro][derive-macro-rust] which must precede the enum declaration.
This wraps our enum in the data structures it will need to interface with other types in our
runtime.

Great, we now know how to create a custom struct and specify its default value. But what about
providing a way for a Kitty struct to be _assigned_ a gender value? For that we need to learn one
more thing.

#### B. Configuring Functions For Our Kitty Struct

Configuring a struct is useful in order to pre-define a value in our struct. For example, when
setting a value in relation to what another function returns. In our case we have a similar
situation where we need to configure our Kitty struct in such a way that sets `Gender` according to
a Kitty's DNA.

We'll only be using this function when we get to [creating Kitties](/docs/tutorials/Kitties/Part%201/dispatchables-and-events#2-write-the-create_kitty-dispatchable).
Regardless, let us learn how to write it now and get it out of the way. We'll create a public
function called `gen_gender` that returns the `Gender` type and uses a random function to choose
between `Gender` enum values.

Replace ACTION #4 with the following code snippet:

```rust
fn gen_gender() -> Gender {
	let random = T::KittyRandomness::random(&b"gender"[..]).0;
	match random.as_ref()[0] % 2 {
		0 => Gender::Male,
		_ => Gender::Female,
	}
}
```

Now whenever `gen_gender()` is called inside our pallet, it will return a pseudo random enum value
for `Gender`.

### 3. Implement On-chain Randomness

If we want to be able to tell these Kitties apart, we need to start giving them unique properties!
In the previous step, we've made use of `KittyRandomness` which we haven't actually defined yet.
Let's get to it.

We'll be using the [Randomness trait][randomness-rustdocs] from `frame_support` to do this. It will
be able to generate a random seed which we'll create unique Kitties with as well as breed new
ones.

In order to use the `Randomness` trait for our pallet, we must:

**A. Define a new type bound by `Randomness` trait in our pallet's configuration trait.**

The `Randomness` trait from `frame_support` requires specifying it with a paramater to replace the
`Output` and `BlockNumber` generics. Take a look at [the documentation][randomness-rustdocs] and
the source code implementation to understand how this works. For our purposes, we want the output
of functions using this trait to be [`H256`][h256-rustdocs] which you'll notice should already be
declared at the top of your working codebase.

Replace the ACTION #5 line with:

```rust
type KittyRandomness: Randomness<Self::H256, Self::BlockNumber>;
```

**B. Specify the actual type in our runtime.**

Given that we have added a new type in the configuration of our pallet, we need to config our
runtime to set its concrete type. This could come in handy if ever we want to change the algorithm
that `KittyRandomness` is using, without needing to modify where it's used inside our pallet.

To showcase this point, we're going to set the `KittyRandomness` type to an instance of
[FRAME's `RandomnessCollectiveFlip`][randomness-collective-flip-frame]. Conveniently, the Node
Template already has an instance of the `RandomnessCollectiveFlip` pallet. All you need to do
is **set the `KittyRandomness` type in your runtime, inside `runtime/src/lib.rs`**:

```rust
impl pallet_kitties::Config for Runtime {
	type Event = Event;
	type KittyRandomness = RandomnessCollectiveFlip; // <-- ACTION: add this line.
}
```

Programming is about abstraction. Here we have abstracted out the randomness generation
implementation (`RandomnessCollectiveFlip`) from its interface (
`Randomness<Self::H256, Self::BlockNumber>` trait).

:::tip
Check out this [how-to guide](/docs/pallet-design/randomness) on implementing randomness in case
you get stuck.
:::

#### Generating random DNA

Generating DNA is similar to using randomness to randomly assign a gender type. The difference is
that we'll be making use of `blake2_128` we imported in the previous part. Replace the ACTION #7
line with:

```rust
fn gen_dna() -> [u8; 16] {
	let payload = (
		T::KittyRandomness::random(&b"dna"[..]).0,
		<frame_system::Pallet<T>>::block_number(),
	);
	payload.using_encoded(blake2_128)
}
```

### 4. Write Remaining Storage Items

#### A. Understanding storage item logic

To easily track all of our kitties, we're going to standardize our logic to use a unique ID as the
global key for our storage items. This means that a single unique key will point to our Kitty
object (i.e. the struct we previously declared).

In order for this to work, we need to make sure that the ID for a new Kitty is always unique. We can
do this with a new storage item `Kitties` which will be a mapping from an ID (Hash) to the Kitty
object.

With this object, we can easily check for collisions by simply checking whether this storage item
already contains a mapping using a particular ID. For example, from inside a dispatchable function
we could check using:

```rust
ensure!(!<Kitties<T>>::exists(new_id), "This new id already exists");
```

Our runtime needs to be made aware of:

1. Unique assets, like currency or Kitties (this will be held by a storgae map called `Kitties`)
2. Ownership of those assets, like account IDs (this will be handled a new storage map called
`KittiesOwned`)

#### B. Using a `StorageMap`

To create a storage instance for the `Kitty` struct, we'll be using[`StorageMap`][storage-map-kb]
&mdash; a hash-map provided to us by FRAME.

Here's what the `Kitties` storage item looks like:

```rust
#[pallet::storage]
#[pallet::getter(fn kitty)]
pub(super) type Kitties<T: Config> = StorageMap<
	_,
	Twox64Concat,
	T::Hash,
	Kitty<T>
	>;
```

Breaking it down, we declare the storage type and assign a `StorageMap` that takes:

- The [`Twox64Concat`][2x64-rustdocs] hashing algorithm.
- A key of type `T::Hash`.
- A value of type `Kitty<T>`.

The `KittiesOwned` storage item is similar except that we'll be using a `BoundedVec` to keep track
of some maximum number of Kitties we'll configure in `runtime/src/lib.s`.

```rust
#[pallet::storage]
#[pallet::getter(fn kitties_owned)]
pub(super) type Kitties<T: Config> = StorageMap<
	_,
	Twox64Concat,
	T::AccountId,
	BoundedVec<T::Hash, T::MaxKittyOwned>,
	ValueQuery
	>;
```

Your turn! Copy the two code snippets above to replace line ACTION #8.

Before we can check our pallet compiles, we need to add a new type `MaxKittyOwned` in the config
trait, which is a pallet constant type (similar to `KittyRandomness` in the previous steps).
Replace ACTION #9 with:

```rust
#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
	//...
	#[pallet::constant]
	type MaxKittyOwned: Get<u32>;
}
```
Finally, we define `MaxKittyOwned` type in `runtime/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
parameter_types! {              // <- add this macro
	// One can own at most 9,999 Kitties
	pub const MaxKittyOwned: u32 = 9999;
	}

/// Configure the pallet-kitties in pallets/kitties.
impl pallet_kitties::Config for Runtime {
	type Event = Event;
	type Currency = Balances;
	type KittyRandomness = RandomnessCollectiveFlip;
	type MaxKittyOwned = MaxKittyOwned; // <- add this line
}
```

Assuming you've followed the above steps correctly, now is a good time to check that your pallet compiles:

```bash
cargo build -p pallet-kitties
```
